# Asylum Seekers

**Introduction**

In theory, political asylum is designed to function as a way to seek refuge from oppressive governments by moving to more welcoming governments. In reality, applicants often are challenged to find a country willing to accept them.  
  
This tool is designed to shine light upon the sources of asylum applicants and the countries they choose to go to, and how easy that process is.
You'll find graphics that show how likely governments are to accept asylum applicants, where asylum applicants tend to come from, and where they tend to go.  

**Technical**  

The app is built using Shiny, with key functionality from packages including tidyverse, shinyBS, leaflet, and maps.

All of the data is sourced from the [UN High Commissioner on Refugees](https://www.unhcr.org/)  

A big thanks to the UNHCR team for curating this data and making it publicly accessible!
